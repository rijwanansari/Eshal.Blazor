# Eshal.Blazor - A blazor project with dynamic and reuseable components

Blazor is a modern web framework developed by Microsoft that is changing the way developers build interactive web applications. Blazor lets you build rich client-side web experiences using C# and .NET instead of JavaScript. One of the most powerful features of Blazor is its component-based architecture, which encourages the reuse of code and modular design.
